### Brown/RISD Buy+Sell
What is it?
A web app that combines the functionality of brown buying and selling, depop, and on-campus clothing swaps! It would display photos in a grid like depop and instagram, organized by item type instead of seller, to support quick and easy browsing.
Problems the project is attempting to solve
The current platform (facebook buying and selling) is terrible. It’s hard to browse through items because they are posts or links to google slides. The facebook algorithm prioritizes some posts and hides others.
Required features
Accounts
User logins (linked to brown gmail?)
mailbox number!
rating
Clean interface -> photo grid
Post things to sell
Tags
Categories
Price
recent	
(Maybe) Helps buyer set prices by using existing data of similar product
Either meet up to exchange item or drop off in mailbox
Either order posts by most recent or include an algorithm that prioritizes posts most relevant to the user based on their size, gender, etc.
Allow users to save posts they like
challenges
managing multiple accounts
Should we include built in pay feature?
Should we include built in messaging?
### Goal Tracker

What is it?
A web app that makes it easy to set goals and keep track of them as well as give you a sense of satisfaction for getting things done. 
Problems the project is attempting to solve / how
There is no to-do list app/goal tracker app that I like. For like, casual to-dos and goals
Required features
Input goals and tasks that are part of a goal
timeline/deadline
Reminders
Make it simple to set up goals and to change them
Maybe some goals can be collaborative
challenges
sns if we decide to implement
keeping things generic

### Reverse Recipes

Problem the project is attempting to solve/how
With millions of delicious recipes on the web, the biggest limitation to what we can make are the ingredients we currently have. The primary purpose of this project would be finding popular and highly-rated recipes that the user can make given several constraints (ingredients, utensils, time spent, cuisine). 
Required features
Allows you to input the food/utensils/appliances that you have as a list and outputs what you can make
Have an account that stores a ‘default’ list of ingredients you have, which you can add and delete items from
Keep track of allergies, dietary restrictions (vegetarian, kosher)
Bonus features
Add in natural language processing/voice recognition so you can say what ingredients you have to speed up input time
Challenges
Integrating app with Recipes APIs to retrieve and store recipes
Efficiently finding recipes that satisfy constraints from very large database of possibilities
